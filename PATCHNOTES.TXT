Gameplay:
    - The trains will only move when the day is going.
    - The round timer has been increased as an adjustment to the train changes.
    - After 10 sections build for a singualar line you can add an extra train by doubleclicking on a section of the line.

Performance:
    - Decreased lag while playing. All trains should be synchronised to each other in each frame.

Bugfixes:
    - Fixed app freeze at the start of a new day or mid game when a train enters a station. It was caused by circular routes resulting the pathfinder entering into an infinite loop at some cases.
    - Fixed an issue where trains were invisible when stopping at stations.
