Gameplay:
    - The trains will only move when the day is going.
    - The round timer has been increased as an adjustment to the train changes.
    - After 10 sections build for a singular line you can add an extra train by double clicking on a section of the line.
    - Passengers are represented by small circles which are the same color as their destination.
    - If you keep a station too busy for 60 seconds the game will be over. A station is busy when more than 6 people are waiting.

Performance:
    - Decreased lag while playing. All trains should be synchronised to each other in each frame.

Bugfixes:
    - Fixed app freeze at the start of a new day or mid game when a train enters a station. It was caused by circular routes resulting the pathfinder entering into an infinite loop at some cases.
    - Fixed an issue where trains were invisible when stopping at stations.
