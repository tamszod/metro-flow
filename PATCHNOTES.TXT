Performance:
    - Decreased lag while playing. All trains should be synchronised to each other in each frame.

Gameplay:
    - The trains will only move when the day is going.
    - The round timer has been increased as an adjustment to the train changes.

Bugfixes:
    - Fixed random app freeze at the start of the day or mid game when a train enters a station.
