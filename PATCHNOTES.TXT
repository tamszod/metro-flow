Known Issues:
    - If you build shared sections between different lines. Only one of them will be visible. (To be fixed in 3.1)
    - If you have shared sections of lines and delete one of them the route will be inaccessable for passengers until you delete the other section and rebuild it. (To be fixed in 3.1)
    - If you add extra trains to a line then delete sections and the criteria is no longer met, the extra trains will be not removed.

ALPHA 2.2

Gameplay:
    - The trains will only move when the day is going.
    - The round timer has been increased as an adjustment to the train changes.
    - After 10 sections build for a singular line you can add an extra train by double clicking on a section of the line.
    - Passengers are represented by small circles which are the same color as their destination.
    - If you keep a station too busy for 60 seconds the game will be over. A station is busy when more than 10 people are waiting.
    - The maximum capacity of a train is 8 passengers.
    - A train generates as many passengers as many day old it is until it is 4 days old, at that point it will generate 4 passengers per day. 

Performance:
    - Decreased lag while playing. All trains should be synchronised to each other in each frame.

Bugfixes:
    - Fixed app freeze at the start of a new day or mid game when a train enters a station. It was caused by circular routes resulting the pathfinder entering into an infinite loop at some cases.
    - Fixed an issue where trains were invisible when stopping at stations.
